			<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  I moved to the United States when I was 2 years old.  My family lived in New Jersey, then Philadelphia, and then Milwaukee.  I grew up in Glendale.  I went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and graduated with a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Molecular Biology.
</p><br>
<p>I attended the University of Wisconsin Medical School, but I didn't graduate.  I ended up getting a job with a law firm in Milwaukee as a marketing assistant.  This grew into a wonderful career running a nonprofit legal trade association:  The National Association of Minority and Women Law Firms.  
</p><br>
<p>I attended Marquette University Law School and graduated in 2010.  I initially worked for the same law firm, but eventually started my own business.
</p><br>
<p>During my lifetime, I have traveled to Belize and India:  Belize in 2003 and India in 2008 (and 2015).  I have also traveled around the United States, to California, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Texas.</p>
